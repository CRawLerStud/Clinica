# Clinica

An app developed during the practice for the final exam at Advanced Methods of Programming.

STORY:
The code is written for a private clinic that still uses a register for appointments. 

<b>The entities are</b>
<li> Sectie (Department) </li>
<li> Medic (Doctor) </li>
<li> Consultatie (Consultation) </li>
<br>
<b>The features</b>
<li> As a nurse, you can create a new appointment for a specific department </li>
<li> The doctors and the departaments are read from a database,
you can not add or delete any of them from the app </li>
<li> Every doctor has a window, where he can see what are his next appointments </li>
<li> Every time a new appointment is made, it appears immediately on the doctor's window </li>
<br>
During the process, I learned how to use an Observable, Observer for updating multiple items when a change is made, I improved my coding skills in JavaFX.
